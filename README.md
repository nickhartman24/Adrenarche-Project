This is all code associated with Nick Hartman's (CU Boulder Anthropology PhD Student) Adrenarche Project.
This project uses comparison of genetic variation between humans and Neanderthals for genes in the DHEAS hormone biosynthesis pathway. 
The data will be interpreted and applied to answering the question "Is the modern human pattern of extended adrenarche unique to Homo sapiens, or does it have a more ancient evolutionary origin?"
I hope to publish the results of this study in 2026.
